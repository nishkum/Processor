This is a single cycle processor built using logisim.

PRE-REQUISITES:
	This requires logisim installed on the computer.

USAGE:
	This processor supports the SimpleRISC ISA.
Note:
	SimpleRISC is an ISA , which is very similar to ARM ISA , developed in IIT Delhi for the purpose of teaching.

	The processor consists of sub-circuits. The IF sub-circuit consists of the instruction memory, which by default is loaded by a program that calculates the value of 4! and stores the result in register r1.
	This can be seen by running the processor by enabling the clock and then checking the value of register r1 under the RegisterFile sub-circuit under the OF sub-circuit .The value should be 24 ,i.e. in hex: 0x 0000 0018.
